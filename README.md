## Alloy - Launcher and Automator

<img src="Alloy%20-%20Launcher%20and%20Automator/ipad-pro-12-9-2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 400px;">

"Alloy - launcher and automator" is all about automating your day-to-day activities. Whether you just need to launch an
app or automate your workflow - Alloy makes it simple and handy with just one click. So, if you need to post today's
photos with added watermark to Facebook, send a canned message to someone, save and track your parking place and time,
automate Siri, use AI to work with texts and pictures etc. - just create corresponding Actions and use them again
and again. With Alloy, you can:

- Make small apps rather than workflows
- Perform some workflows in background
- Make your own widgets (glances)
- Use AI and Cloud services for your actions
- Make your own chat interfaces to any chat services
- Associate actions to NFC tags
- Process Siri requests in background and return graphical results back to Siri
- Launch your actions right form iMessage and share results with your contacts
- Associate reminders with actions
- Create Lists from templates on schedule or location change
- Debug your actions using breakpoints, inspectors, logs, etc.
- And much more!

"Alloy - launcher and automator" is suitable for any user. No matter who you are, a newbie, or an experienced user, you
will find Alloy handy and fun to play with. Newbies can easily make simple Actions in minutes just by defining a basic 
workflow combining several tasks together. Experienced users can build more sophisticated Actions using loops,
conditional operators, Web Services, workflow calls, etc.

"Alloy - launcher and automator" is wherever you need it. You can make Siri Shortcuts for any Alloy's Actions and then
launch those Actions from Siri by speaking certain phrases. It is even possible to make Siri Shortcuts that run in
background without leaving Siri... You can use Alloy right from Messages to share Action's result (e.g., tip calculation)
with friends. Or you can use Alloy's Widget in the Notification Center to get quick access to the Favorite Actions, etc.

"Alloy - launcher and automator" combines the best of two worlds:
Advanced launcher with dynamic favorites based on your habits, location, and usage statistics.
Sophisticated workflow engine, which allows building Actions using REST Web Services, system and Cloud services,
installed apps, etc.

Sample Actions that Alloy can do with just one click are:

- post today's photos with added watermark to Facebook
- calculate a tip
- send group SMS and email
- send canned SMS to someone
- save parking place and set up a reminder to leave
- find the best pizza place around on Yelp
- upload new photos to Dropbox and send links of them by email
- convert EUR to USD using Convertible
- navigate to a certain location using Google Map
- etc.

You can either use ready-to-use Actions from built-in Action Directory or build your own Actions using a simple yet
powerful Action Editor. Alloy allows you to create custom Actions that will meet your specific needs and desires. You
can customize Action's workflows, background, layout, colors, folders, and so much more! If you are ready to create your
first customized Action, take a look at our “Alloy Getting Started Guide” or ask our Support Team.

Alloy eliminates the need to browse through several pages full of apps to find an app or Action to launch - dynamic
Favorites provide you just with the right set of necessary apps and actions based on your habits, location, and usage
statistics. You can even use Siri Shortcuts to launch Actions by voice.

## Java Class Extension Library

<img src="img/java-class-extension-library.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Java Class Extension Library - powerful library that emulates class extensions (categories) in Java. In addition, it
supports interfaces and object composition, interface adoption, object unions and aspects.

Class extensions (categories) are beneficial because they:
- Improve code organization by separating core data structures from specialized functionality.
- Enhance modularity, allowing domain-specific logic to be added without modifying original classes.
- Promote the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping data classes focused on data representation.
- Enable adding new features to existing types, including third-party or framework types.
- Facilitate better separation of concerns in complex applications.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Allows adding aspects in addition to adding operations.

These benefits lead to more flexible, maintainable, and efficient code structures. Unfortunately, Java does not natively
support class extensions (categories) and there is a little chance such support is going to be introduced in the near
future. Java Class Extension library provides a valuable alternative for native class extensions with just a little more
verbose code and little more complex implementation.

The library supports the following approaches for creating of class extensions:

- **Static Class Extensions**: define and implement extensions as usual Java classes and then use the Java Class
  Extension library to find matching extensions.
- **Dynamic Class Extensions**: utilize the Java Class Extension library to define extensions by composing them as sets
  of lambda operations and let the library create extensions dynamically on the fly.

Both approaches leverage the ClassExtension interface, which facilitates querying for an extension based on an object's
extension interface. Once obtained, these extensions unlock additional functionality with remarkable ease.

## EasyRouting for Vert.x

<img src="img/easyrouting-for-vertx.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

EasyRouting is a lightweight, annotation-driven HTTP routing library designed to build Vert.x web applications. It
simplifies web development by letting you define routes with Java annotations—no need to manage complex request or
response objects.

Inspired by JAX-RS and Spring Boot’s routing style, EasyRouting provides a focused, minimal solution without the
heaviness of a full framework. It’s ideal for developers who want to build web apps quickly using just basic Java and
HTTP knowledge.

Key Highlights:
- Define routes and configuration using simple annotations on your Java methods.
- Automatic parameter binding and response handling.
- Use plain Java objects; no manual JSON serialization needed.
- Minimal setup; start by extending the Application class and calling start().
- Designed for easy learning with no need to learn Vert.x to get started.

Get started in minutes and build clean, maintainable web apps with less boilerplate code.
